## T88 2 

### rohkem n6udmisi mu kalendrile:
- something about liking that all the mondays are different (here comes the Week concept...)
- something about, yes, 0 being 2020, because minuses and the new world, global, the beginning
- march instead of the august (building up the from august path will be our legacy art work, but the real time will start with the Nature, Seasons, the ones changing sometimes in other rythms than our perfectly wobbly time mathemathics)
- EASY. it has to be SIMPLE. LIHTE. ("or nobody will start using it," said another Kolkaplika as a feedback).
- THE MOON. both more complex and simple should be possible. stretching time. haha, jaa. we can do it? 



# Siinu m6tted On Time

## Siinu Kalendar

>  Physically and in Time.

Siinu Kalendar started as an acute need to build working conversion models between calendars that are internally consistent, human-usable, and explicit about their assumptions — just enough to make translations between systems possible. Gregorian → other. Other → Gregorian. Fiction → fiction. This project does not aim to replace time. Gregorian time is treated here not as default truth, but as one convention among others. This work aims to make its conventions visible, explicit, and therefore negotiable. Any psychological fallout is considered a side effect of touching infrastructure that usually remains unquestioned. 

## Siina didn’t start thinking about Time because Siina wanted a better calendar. 

```md
1. Siina started to think about Time because the math is funny
2. the math that me(aka we, humans, inimesed) have come up with to keep the time is wobbly
3. & way later, way-way later, because Siina have 30+ YearsOfExperience in Time Anxiety and other nervous systems
4. Siina would like to send Siinu greetings to Sheila Heti && the kolkaplika sisters
```


```java
System.out.println("HAVE YOU ALREADY REALIZED HOW DEEPLY INVISIBLE CONVENTIONS RUN YOUR LIFE? RUN YOUR BODY? RUN YOUR WORK? RUN YOUR SELF?");
System.out.println("ARE YOU RUNNING YOURSELF?");
System.out.println("Are YOU RUNNING FROM YOURSELF?");
```

``` js
let day = thePresentInfinity;
let Month = 28*day;
let Year = 13*Month + day;
let ExtraYear = 13*month + 2*day;
let current.YEAR = 13108;
let begin.YEAR = August1;
```

### 
[p22suke] knows the calendar is conceptually broken.
[] is not be rushed or judged for looping questions

## T88 1 — Buildable Core
this is the write terminali k2sk
```bash
code suund/init/kolkaplika/Time/T881.md
```

and answer the following questions:
* What is a CalendarSystem in code?
* What is a Date without assuming Gregorian?
* How do we represent:
* months?
* month lengths?
* leap rules?
* What does “conversion” actually mean in data terms?

Siina has to accept that this version may be conceptually imperfect and That’s fine. Code is a thinking tool.

## T88 2 — Conceptual Repair 
this is the write terminali k2sk
```bash
code suund/init/kolkaplika/Time/T882.md
```
AND
answer there Questions like:
* Where does the Gregorian calendar smuggle in assumptions?
* What did the 13-month system fix for you?
* What hurt or felt artificial even there?
* What must be explicit instead of “obvious”?

This track feeds back into Track 1 when you’re ready.

### Why Java?
I am building it in Java, because... I need to practice Java? Java hoolib veel tyypidest.
