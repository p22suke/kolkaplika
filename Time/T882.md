## T88 2 

### rohkem n6udmisi mu kalendrile:
- something about liking that all the mondays are different (here comes the Week concept...)
- something about, yes, 0 being 2020, because minuses and the new world, global, the beginning
- march instead of the august (building up the from august path will be our legacy art work, but the real time will start with the Nature, Seasons, the ones changing sometimes in other rythms than our perfectly wobbly time mathemathics)
- EASY. it has to be SIMPLE. LIHTE. ("or nobody will start using it," said another Kolkaplika as a feedback).
- THE MOON. both more complex and simple should be possible. stretching time. haha, jaa. we can do it?
