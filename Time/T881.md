# T88 1 — Buildable Core

## The Broken Concept
Siina has to accept that this version may be conceptually imperfect and That’s fine. 

``` js
let itBeKnown;
```
there are nevertheless two calendars:
```js
let kalendar = kolkaplika(emamaine);
let calendar = gregorian;
```

1. 
* What is a CalendarSystem in code?
* What is a Date without assuming Gregorian?
* How do we represent:
* months?
* month lengths?
* leap rules?
* What does “conversion” actually mean in data terms?



2. In your working design, what are the primitives?

For example (don’t copy, just react):
* year = ?
* month = ?
* day = ?
* is “month” required?
* is “week” real or derived?
* does a date exist without a calendar?
