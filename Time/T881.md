## T88 1 — Buildable Core
this is the write terminali k2sk
```bash
code suund/init/kolkaplika/Time/T881.md
```

and answer the following questions:
* What is a CalendarSystem in code?
* What is a Date without assuming Gregorian?
* How do we represent:
* months?
* month lengths?
* leap rules?
* What does “conversion” actually mean in data terms?

Siina has to accept that this version may be conceptually imperfect and That’s fine. Code is a thinking tool.


1. In your working design, what are the primitives?

For example (don’t copy, just react):
[] year = ?
[] month = ?
[] day = ?
[] is “month” required?
[] is “week” real or derived?
[]  does a date exist without a calendar?

Just list what exists in your head right now.
